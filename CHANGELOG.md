- fix(cexy): pkgconf fixed include dirs flags before linker
- fix: mingw warning visibility attribute not supported in this configuration

## 0.12.0
2025-05-12

### Changes / improvements
- Code base cleanup
- refactor(cexy)!: removed `cexy$cc_args_release/debug` - now it's `cexy$cc_args` (controlled by cex -DSOME_CONF config)
